## Getting Started

BOA has three packages that are available as NPM packages. [@boa/base](/packages/base/) has base components like a composer (HOC), themes, error boundary, enums etc. [@boa/components](/packages/components/) is the main UI component library. [@boa/utils](/packages/utils/) has localization and messaging utilities. Each component was documented on the own package dictionary.
